# 🚀 Deployment Guide - AI News Dashboard

Since Vercel is having authentication issues, here are multiple deployment options:

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

### Steps:
1. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-news-dashboard.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `master` or `main`
   - Save

3. **Your site will be available at**:
   `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/ai-news-dashboard/`

## Option 2: Netlify (Easiest)

### Steps:
1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. **Drag and drop** the entire folder
3. **Get instant deployment URL**

### Or via Git:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Automatic deployments on every push

## Option 3: Vercel (If you fix authentication)

### Steps:
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project**: `ai-news-dashboard`
3. **Settings** → **General**
4. **Disable "Password Protection" or "Authentication"**
5. **Redeploy**

## Option 4: Local Development

### Steps:
```bash
# Start local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

## Option 5: Surge.sh (Alternative)

### Steps:
```bash
# Install Surge
npm install -g surge

# Deploy
surge

# Follow prompts
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If CSS/JS files show 404:
- Check file paths in HTML
- Ensure all files are in the same directory
- Try different deployment platform

### If RSS feeds don't load:
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Try different CORS proxy in `config.js`
- Sample data will show as fallback

### If deployment fails:
- Check file permissions
- Ensure all files are committed
- Try a different platform
